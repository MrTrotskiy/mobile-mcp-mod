## üì¶ Installation

### Local Development (Current)

For active development, use local build:

1. **Build project**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run fixlint
   ```

2. **Configure Cursor** - create `.cursor/mcp.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "mobile-mcp-local": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["lib/index.js"],
         "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
         "env": {}
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Cursor** completely

4. **Test**: `Show installed apps on device`

### NPM Installation (Future)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mobilepixel": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mobilepixel/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: NPM package not yet published. Use local setup above.
